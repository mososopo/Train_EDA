# Train_EDA

This a repository for the project Train_EDA


# Description

This project was created with the purpose of identify the correlation for the variable in the dataset Train.csv. Here are some of the most stronger correlation between variable for the dataset Train.csv, please grab the file from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regressiontechniques/code). 

For each one of the correlations mentioned in this document, we created a plots that briefly describe the correlation between the variables and also analyzed the distribution of the
dataset.

# Usage

The purpose of this project is allow data analyst to train and improve their data analysis skills by creating EDA and also analysing variables distribution.

# Packages

This project contain three packages, first package or folder is "Code", this folder contains the generated codes oriented to do the exploratory data analysis of the variables in the dataset and also analyze the distribution of each variable. The second folder, "Dataset" contains the dataset itself, and the last folder, "Documentation", contains a document with the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of the dataset Train.csv.
